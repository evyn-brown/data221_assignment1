file1: create a loop to consecutively multiply integers until first instance where the product is greater than threshold value. Prints the integer where the product is greater than threshold, prints the product that is greater than the threshold.

file2: define function stringToDictionary(userList=[]) to receive a list of strings and return a dictionary such that: Each key is a string from the list, each value is another dictionary containing, The length of the string, Whether the length is even or odd. function will print the new dictionary

file3: given a list of pairs (x,y), new function exponentiationOfList(pairs=[]) will compute x^y for each pair on list where y is a positive value, computed and stored in a new list

file4: Sort list of random numbers (between 0 and 1) in ascending order, given random value X, find first number in sorted list which is greater than X value. Prints sorted list, value greater than X and at which index the number is greater than x.

file5: Calculates area of two circles based on user input of raddis if raddis are possitive.
Then returns percentage of larger circle area that can be covered by smaller circles area, prints results to user. If given raddis are negative, an error message is provided and no calculation will be computed. 

file6: define function returnDictionary(numbers=[]) that receives a list of numbers and returns dictionary with key as number from list (Ascending order) and value as percent of numbers in list greater than given number

file7:function secondToTime(seconds=0) to receive seconds as input and convert it to the designated time of day

file8: Create a dataframe based on given data and pandas package, then creates a new column with values derived from mathematical operations of the previous 3 columns.
